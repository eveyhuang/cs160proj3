Ingredients
1,5 cups blueberries
0,5 tbsp honey
1 tbsp lemon juice
2/3 cup natural (unsweetened/salted) almond butter
170g dark chocolate, roughly chopped

Extras:
Non-stick cupcake liners, small or large



Method

Preheat the oven to 180C.

In a medium-sized bowl, combine the blueberries, honey and lemon juice. 
Mix well. Place in a single layer on an oven-tray and roast for 10-15 minutes, 
until the blueberries have released some of their juices. 
Let cool at room temperature.

While the blueberries are roasting, melt the chocolate in a tight-fitting bowl over a pot of boiling water. 
When the chocolate is melted, place a tablespoon of it into a cupcake liner and swirl it around to coat the sides about 2-3 cm high. 
Repeat with the rest of the liners and place in the freezer to solidify for 15-30 minutes. 

When the chocolate has solidified, place a teaspoon of almond butter in each and top with a tablespoon of roasted blueberries and their juices. 
Top with a tablespoon of melted chocolate (if it has solidified then place in back over boiling water, slowly heat it up again). 
Place the cups in the freezer for 30 minutes or until solidified. Keep in the fridge or freezer. Enjoy!
